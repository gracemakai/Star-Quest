### 💡 Inspiration
Built as an improved version of the Ember Quest Flame tutorial.
I wanted to create a fun, polished platformer that showcased my game dev skills in a simple but exciting way.

### Run the game locally:

```bash
# Make sure you have Flutter and FVM set up
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run -d chrome
```
